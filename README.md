Essential Routines for Astronomy

This repository contains scripts for converting the Standards of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) library to a form that can be re-licensed with a BSD license.

To compile and execute the tests, do:

    [CC] eras.c test_eras.c -o test_eras
    ./test_eras --verbose

where ``[CC]`` is replaced by your preferred C compiler.
